# Sailing-Navigation
Python scripts to aid navigation at sea

Work in progress

The aim of this project is to create a python package to automate the manual calculations I find myself doing during off-shore ocean racing. 
Mainly, target heading & target speed.  I'd also like to produce a live handicaped leaderboard based on AIS information as we race.
  
It will run on a Raspberry Pi and be based on the kplex (https://github.com/stripydog/kplex) project.

The output will initially be termainal based.
